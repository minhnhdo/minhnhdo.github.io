<h2 id="set-covers">Set Covers</h2>
<p>An <em>open cover</em>, or cover, of a set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> in metric space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a collection of open sets, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\{G_\alpha\}\)</span>, whose union covers, or contains, <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</p>
<p>A <em>subcover</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\{G_\alpha\}\)</span> is a subcollection <span class="math inline">\(\{G_{\alpha_\gamma}\}\)</span> that still covers <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<ol class="example" type="1">
<li>In <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)\)</span> has cover <span class="math inline">\(\{V_n\}_{n = 3}^{\infty}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(V_n = \left(\frac{1}{n}, 1 - \frac{1}{n}\right)\)</span>. It also has cover <span class="math inline">\(\{(0, 2)\}\)</span>. It also has cover <span class="math inline">\(\{W_x\}_{x \in \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(W_x = N_\frac{1}{10}(x)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\{V_n\}_{n = 3}^{\infty}\)</span> has subcovers <span class="math inline">\(\{V_n\}_{n = 22}^{\infty}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{V_n\}_{n = 1000000}^{\infty}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\{(0, 2)\}\)</span> has only one subcover <span class="math inline">\(\{(0, 2)\}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\{W_x\}_{x \in \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)}\)</span> has a subcover <span class="math inline">\(\left\{W_\frac{5}{10}, W_\frac{6}{10}, W_\frac{7}{10}, W_\frac{8}{10}, W_\frac{8}{10}, W_\frac{9}{10}\right\}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\([0, 1] \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> has a cover by <span class="math inline">\(\{V_n\} \cup \{W_0, W_1\}\)</span>. A finite subcover is <span class="math inline">\(\{W_0, W_1, V_{11}\}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compact-sets">Compact Sets</h2>
<p>A set <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is <em>compact</em> (in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) if every open cover of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> contains a finite subcover.</p>
<p>So, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is not compact means there exists an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> with no finite subcover.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<ol start="3" class="example" type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)\)</span> is not compact (see <span class="math inline">\(\{V_n\}\)</span>).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is not compact. One witness cover is <span class="math inline">\(\{U_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(U_i = \left(i - \frac{1}{10}, i + \frac{1}{10}\right)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Finite sets are compact.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Consider some open cover <span class="math inline">\(\{G_\alpha\}\)</span> covering <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\)</span>. For all <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>, choose <span class="math inline">\(G_{\alpha_i}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\{G_{\alpha_i}\}_{i = 1}^n\)</span> covers the set. QED.</p>
<p>A set <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is <em>bounded</em> if there is some ball <span class="math inline">\(N_r(x)\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(K \subset N_r(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Compact sets are bounded.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Consider a compact set <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(B(x) = N_1(x)\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(B(x)\)</span> are balls of radius <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Consider a collection <span class="math inline">\(\{B(x)\}_{x \in K}\)</span>, which is an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. By compactness of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, there exists a finite subcover <span class="math inline">\(\{B(x_i)\}_{i = 1}^n\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(R = max_{1 \leq i \leq n}\{d(x_1, x_i)\}\)</span>; this maximum exists because the set <span class="math inline">\(\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}\)</span> is finite. Then <span class="math inline">\(N_{R + 2}(x_1)\)</span> contains all of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. QED.</p>
<h2 id="relative-open-sets">Relative Open Sets</h2>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(Y \subset X\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a metric space, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is said to <em>inherit</em> a metric from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>A set <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is <em>open</em> in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (or <em>open relative</em> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>) if every point of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is an interior point of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. Here, the notion of interior is using the neighborhoods in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(E \subset Y \subset X\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is open in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(E = Y \cap G\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> open in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="compactness-is-intrinsic">Compactness is Intrinsic</h2>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(K \subset Y \subset X\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a metric space. Then <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em></p>
<p>(<span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>): Assume <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Consider any open cover <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(V_\alpha = U_\alpha \cap Y\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\{V_\alpha\}\)</span> covers <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, there exists a finite subcover <span class="math inline">\(\{V_{\alpha_1}, \dots, V_{\alpha_n}\}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\{U_{\alpha_1}, \dots, U_{\alpha_n}\}\)</span> is a finite subcover of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, as desired.</p>
<p>(<span class="math inline">\(\Leftarrow\)</span>): Assume <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Consider any open cover <span class="math inline">\(\{V_\alpha\}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. By above theorem, there exists open <span class="math inline">\(U_\alpha\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(V_\alpha = U_\alpha \cap Y\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> covers <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.

QED.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-between-compact-sets-and-closed-sets">Relationship between Compact Sets and Closed Sets</h2>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Compact sets are closed.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Let <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> be compact. Consider <span class="math inline">\(p \notin K\)</span>. We’ll show <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> has a neighborhood that does not intersect <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a limit point of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>). For any <span class="math inline">\(q \in K\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(V_q = N_\frac{r}{2}(q)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_q = N_\frac{r}{2}(p)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r = d(p, q)\)</span>. Notice <span class="math inline">\(\{V_q\}\)</span> is an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. By compactness of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, there exists a finite subcover <span class="math inline">\(\{V_{q_1}, \dots, V_{q_n}\}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(W = \bigcap_{i = 1}^n U_{q_i}\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is an intersection of finitely many open sets. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is open (it is a ball of radius <span class="math inline">\(\min \left\{\frac{d(p, q_i)}{2}\right\}\)</span>). We have <span class="math inline">\(W \cap V_{q_i} = \emptyset\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(W \subset V_{q_i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_{q_i} \cap U_{q_i} = \emptyset\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is the desired neighborhood. QED.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<ol start="5" class="example" type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\((0, 1)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is not compact because it’s not closed.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is not compact although it’s closed because it’s not bounded.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> A closed subset <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> of a compact set <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Consider any open cover <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is closed, <span class="math inline">\(B^c\)</span> is open. So <span class="math inline">\(B^c \cup \{U_\alpha\}\)</span> is an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact, there exists a finite subcover <span class="math inline">\(\{U_{\alpha_1}, \dots, U_{\alpha_n}, B^c\}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(B^c \cap B = \emptyset\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{U_{\alpha_1}, \dots, U_{\alpha_n}\}\)</span> covers <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and it is a finite subcover of the original cover. QED.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary.</strong> Suppose set <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is closed and set <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact. Then <span class="math inline">\(B \cap K\)</span> is compact.</p>
<p>Consider intervals <span class="math inline">\(I_n = [a_n, b_n]\)</span>. They are <em>nested</em> means if <span class="math inline">\(m &gt; n\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(a_n \leq a_m \leq b_m \leq b_n\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Nested closed intervals in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> are not empty (in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^k\)</span>, nested closed <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-cells are not empty).</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Let <span class="math inline">\(x = \sup\{a_i\}\)</span>. It exists because <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>’s are bounded by <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a supremum, <span class="math inline">\(x \geq a_i\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. We have <span class="math inline">\(x \leq b_i\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> is an upper bound of all <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>’s (due to nestedness). QED.</p>
<p>Aside: <em>Proof that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is uncountable.</em> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is countable, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R} = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots\}\)</span>. Choose closed intervals <span class="math inline">\(I_1\)</span> that misses <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I_2 \subset I_1\)</span> that misses <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I_3 \subset I_2\)</span> that misses <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span>, and so on. So, <span class="math inline">\(I_n\)</span> is a nested closed interval. By previous theorem, there exists a point in <span class="math inline">\(\bigcap I_n\)</span> that is not one of the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>’s and is thus not on the original listing. QED.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Any closed interval <span class="math inline">\([a, b]\)</span> is compact (in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>). This is also true for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-cells in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^k\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof (by contradiction).</em> Suppose there is a closed interval <span class="math inline">\([a, b]\)</span> that is not compact. Then there exists an open cover <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\([a, b]\)</span> which has no finite subcover. Then <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> covers both <span class="math inline">\([a, c_1]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([c_1, b]\)</span>, at least one of which has no finite subcover of <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span>. Without loss of generality, assume <span class="math inline">\(I_1 = [a, c_1]\)</span> has no finite subcover. Subdivide <span class="math inline">\(I_1\)</span> again using <span class="math inline">\(c_2\)</span> which is the half way point of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_1\)</span>. Note that at least one of <span class="math inline">\([a, c_2]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([c_2, c_1]\)</span> has no finite subcover. Continue and we’ll obtain <span class="math inline">\(I_1 \supset I_2 \supset I_3 \supset \dots\)</span> of nested closed intervals, each halves at each step and has no finite subcover of <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span>. By the nested interval theorem, there exists <span class="math inline">\(x \in I_n\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is in some <span class="math inline">\(U_\widehat{\alpha}\)</span> of the cover <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(U_\widehat{\alpha}\)</span> is open, there exists an <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; 0\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(N_r(x) \subset U_\widehat{\alpha}\)</span>. Since the intervals halve at each step, some <span class="math inline">\(I_n\)</span> is contained in <span class="math inline">\(N_r(x)\)</span>. This means that <span class="math inline">\(G_\widehat{\alpha}\)</span> covers <span class="math inline">\(I_n\)</span>, which contradicts the fact that it has no finite subcover. QED.</p>
<h2 id="the-heine-borel-theorem">The Heine-Borel Theorem</h2>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> In <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> (or in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact if and only if <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is both closed and bounded.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em></p>
<p>(<span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>): already done.</p>
<p>(<span class="math inline">\(\Leftarrow\)</span>): (it is not true in arbitrary metric spaces) Since <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is bounded, <span class="math inline">\(K \subset [-r, r]\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; 0\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is closed (by assumption) and <span class="math inline">\([-r, r]\)</span> is compact (by the previous theorem), <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is also compact. QED.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, replace closed interval by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-cell.</p>
<p>For example,</p>

<li>Discrete metric on infinite set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is closed and bounded but is not compact.</li>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact if and only if every infinite subset <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> has a limit point in <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em></p>
<p>(<span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>): If no point in <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is a limit point of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> then each point <span class="math inline">\(q \in E\)</span> has a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(V_q\)</span> containing no other point of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> other than <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\{V_q\}\)</span> covers <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> with no finite subcover, implying <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is not compact, which is a contradiction.</p>
<p>(<span class="math inline">\(\Leftarrow\)</span>) proof for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> but is true for all metric spaces: Need to show <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is closed and bounded.

There exists a point <span class="math inline">\(p \notin K\)</span> that is a limit point of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. Choose <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(d(x_n, z) &lt; \frac{1}{n}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> has a limit point at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and no other.

<p><strong>Corollary (Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem).</strong> Every bounded infinite subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> has a limit point in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> If subset <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is bounded then <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is in some compact <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-cell.

<p>A collection of sets has the <em>finite intersection property</em> if any finite subcollection has a non-empty intersection.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (due to Cantor).</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(\{K_\alpha\}\)</span> be compact subsets of some metric space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\{K_\alpha\}\)</span> has the finite intersection property then the intersection of all <span class="math inline">\(K_\alpha\)</span> is non-empty.</p>
<p><em>Proof (by contradiction).</em> Let <span class="math inline">\(U_\alpha = K_\alpha^c\)</span>, which is open. Choose an arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\{K_\alpha\}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\bigcap\limits_\alpha K_\alpha = \emptyset\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> covers <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact, there exists a finite subcover <span class="math inline">\(\{U_{\alpha_1}, \dots U_{\alpha_n}\}\)</span> covering <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.

<p><strong>Corollary.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(\{K_n\}\)</span> be a sequence of compact nested sets. Then <span class="math inline">\(\bigcap_{n = 1}^\infty K_n\)</span> is non-empty.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Any space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is compact if and only if any collection of closed sets <span class="math inline">\(\{D_\alpha\}\)</span> that satisfies the finite intersection property has a non-empty intersection (or, if <em>every</em> finite subcollection has non-empty intersection, then <span class="math inline">\(\bigcap D_\alpha \neq \emptyset\)</span>).</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em></p>
<p>(<span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>): Consider <span class="math inline">\(\{D_\alpha\}\)</span>. These are closed subset of a compact space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, so they are compact. Apply the previous theorem to get the conclusion.</p>
<p>(<span class="math inline">\(\Leftarrow\)</span>, by contrapositive): Assume <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is not compact.

Since <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> is a cover, every point <span class="math inline">\(y \in X\)</span> is in <span class="math inline">\(\bigcup\limits_\alpha U_\alpha\)</span>, which implies every point <span class="math inline">\(y \in X\)</span> is not in <span class="math inline">\(\bigcap\limits_\alpha U_\alpha\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(\bigcap\limits_\alpha U_\alpha = \emptyset\)</span>. Consider any subcollection <span class="math inline">\(\{U_{\alpha_i}\}_{i = 1}^n\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\{U_{\alpha_i}\}_{i = 1}^n\)</span> is not a subcover of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, there exists <span class="math inline">\(x \in X \setminus \bigcup\limits_{i = 1}^n U_{\alpha_i}\)</span>, which implies <span class="math inline">\(x \in X \cap \bigcap\limits_{i = 1}^n U_{\alpha_i}\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(\bigcap\limits_{i = 1}^n U_{\alpha_i} \neq \emptyset\)</span>, as desired. QED.</p>
<h2 id="perfect-sets">Perfect Sets</h2>
<p>A set is <em>perfect</em> if it is closed and every point is a limit point.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<ol start="9" class="example" type="1">
<li>Any closed interval <span class="math inline">\([a, b]\)</span> is perfect.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is perfect.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cantor-sets">Cantor Sets</h2>
<p>Start with <span class="math inline">\(K_0 = [0, 1]\)</span>. Construct <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span> by removing the middle third of <span class="math inline">\(K_0\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(K_1 = \left[0, \frac{1}{3}\right] \cup \left[\frac{2}{3}, 1\right]\)</span>. Construct <span class="math inline">\(K_2\)</span> by removing the middle thirds of the intervals in <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(K_2 = \left[0, \frac{1}{9}\right] \cup \left[\frac{2}{9}, \frac{3}{9}\right] \cup \left[\frac{6}{9}, \frac{7}{9}\right] \cup \left[\frac{8}{9}, 1\right]\)</span>. Continue with the construction.</p>
<p>Each <span class="math inline">\(K_n\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span> intervals. Each is closed because each is a finite union of closed sets. Each is compact because each is a closed subset of the compact set <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>. Finally, all <span class="math inline">\(K_n\)</span> are nested. Hence, their intersection is non-empty.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(C = \bigcap\limits_{n = 0}^\infty K_n\)</span>, called the Cantor set. Notice that</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is closed because it is the intersection of arbitrary many closed sets.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is perfect.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> consists of real numbers whose ternary expansion contains only <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>s or <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>s, which shows that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is uncountable (or <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> has non-endpoints of <span class="math inline">\(K_n\)</span>).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> has no interior.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is totally disconnected.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> has measure <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, i.e. for any <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> can be covered by intervals of total length less than <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
